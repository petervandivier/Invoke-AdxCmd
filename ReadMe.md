# Invoke-AdxCmd

Started as a lightweight PowerShell wrapper to connect to Azure Data Explorer and execute arbitrary KQL. Currently growing to include utility functions for interacting with an ADX cluster.

If you're on this page, you probably already know what KQL & ADX are, but so we're all on the same page as to the module author's understanding...

## ADX

[Azure Data Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/) is a SAAS timeseries database with some relational DBMS flair added. It is distinct from [Log Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) although they are both informally called "Kusto" since KQL is used to interact with both. Note Log Analytics has native PowerShellâ†’KQL support in `Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQuery` <sub>([docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.operationalinsights/invoke-azoperationalinsightsquery), [source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.operationalinsights/invoke-azoperationalinsightsquery), [blog](https://learningbydoing.cloud/blog/query-log-analytics-with-kql-from-powershell/))</sub>. This module is only for use with ADX (although some of the utility functions (prefixed KQL instead of ADX) may be portable). 

## KQL

[Kusto Query Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) is the syntax you use for interacting with ADX & Log Analytics. 

Also sometimes abbreviated as CSL. This stands for "Costeau Semantic Language" and was the internal project name at Microsoft before general availability (sadly I have only [informal citations for this](https://twitter.com/TechTrainerTim/status/1534521353503637504)).
